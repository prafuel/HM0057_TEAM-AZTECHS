## How to Get Started

Welcome to our Next.js project for personalized mentorship! Let's get you up and running quickly:

### Project Setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <link of this GitHub repository>
```

### Running the Development Server

After cloning, navigate to the project directory and run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Additional Setup

Before running the project, make sure to install the required Node modules and Python libraries. You can do this by running:
```bash
npm i
```

Also, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed as specified in the Python file for ML model integration.

### Customizing the Application

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### And You're Ready!

With everything set up, you're now ready to explore our platform and embark on your mentorship journey. Enjoy!

--- ## Tech Stack

Our project utilizes a modern and efficient tech stack to provide a seamless user experience:

- **Frontend**: Next.js Framework
  We chose Next.js for the frontend due to its simplicity, especially when routing paths to different pages. Next.js provides a smooth development experience and enables us to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces effortlessly.

- **Design and Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  Tailwind CSS is our go-to choice for designing and styling purposes. Its utility-first approach streamlines the development process, allowing us to create visually appealing and responsive designs with ease. 

- **Backend Integration**: Flask API
  To seamlessly integrate the frontend with our NLP (Natural Language Processing) backend, we employ Flask API. Flask acts as a bridge between the frontend and backend, facilitating smooth communication and ensuring accurate results are displayed based on user prompts.

This tech stack enables us to deliver a robust and user-friendly mentorship platform, providing personalized guidance tailored to each user's needs.
