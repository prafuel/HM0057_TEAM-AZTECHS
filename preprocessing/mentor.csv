I used to be a 9 pointer in college and always dreamt of starting my own business. Foreign interns and high salaries did sway me for a bit but I found my feet eventually. With an insti professor and batchmate, I started a manufacturing company straight out of IIT, which was incubated in SINE. Then when the growth there stabilized, I started a refurshised furniture startup with some IIT alumni. We won the Ten Minute Million at E-cell and scaled it to a lifestyle business. 

I thought of using my manufacturing and trading (furniture) experience and venturing into finance. This led to me starting West Zone operations for Ofbusiness (Series C 30M$ + 100M$ debt line). 1 year fast forward and my team contributes to about INR 25 Cr per month which is about 20% of company topline. 

Being a guide is quite fun for me. I have also mentored a few startups at IIM Ahmedabad and other incubators. Used to be a mentor in the institute as well and also for Avanti Fellows.

Over past few years, I have gained a broad range of experience in manufacturing, consumer goods, commodities sales and also finance. I have held positions in sales, finance and operations roles. If you are stuck somewhere (career/otherwise) and need a holistic perspective, ping me :)",,
